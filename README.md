# ethers-simple-storage

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) instead of `npm`
- [ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)
  - You can alternatively use [ganache-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache-cli) or [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)

## Setup

Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/ethers-simple-storage
cd ethers-simple-storage
```

Then install dependencies

```
yarn
```

## Usage

1. Run your ganache local chain, by hitting `quickstart` on your ganache application

> Save the workspace. This way, next time you open ganache you can start the workspace you've created, otherwise you'll have to redo all the steps below.

2. Copy the `RPC SERVER` sting in your ganache CLI, and place it into your `.env` file similar to what's in `.env.example`.

```
RPC_URL=http://0.0.0.0:8545
```

3. Hit the key on one of the accounts, and copy the key you see and place it into your `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

```
PRIVATE_KEY=11ee3108a03081fe260ecdc106554d09d9d1209bcafd46942b10e02943effc4a
```

4. Compile your code

Run

```
yarn compile
```

You'll see files `SimpleStorage_sol_SimpleStorage.abi` and `SimpleStorage_sol_SimpleStorage.bin` be created.

5. Run your application

```
node deploy.js
```

### For WSL users

1. Run
```
yarn add ganache
```

2. Change Server settings in Ganache

Settings > Server > Host Name 

Change Host Name to vEthernet (WSL)

3. Run your application 

``` 
node deploy.js
```

### Deploying to a testnet

Make sure you have a [metamask](https://metamask.io/) or other wallet, and export the private key.

1. [Export your private key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key) and place it in your `.env` file, as done above.

2. Go to [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981) and create a new project on the testnet of choice (ie, Goerli)
3. Grab your URL associated with the testnet, and place it into your `.env` file.
4. Make sure you have [testnet ETH](https://faucets.chain.link/) in your account. You can [get some here](https://faucets.chain.link/). 
5. Run

```
node deploy.js
```
